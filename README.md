# 2016 Election Russian Facebook Ads

This repository compiles the data from the Facebook advertisements [released by the U.S. House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence](https://intelligence.house.gov/social-media-content/social-media-advertisements.htm). Unfortunately, the public data release is several gigabytes of pdf files. This repository provides a clean version of the text contents and meta data for each advertisement. The data is available for download as a [csv](https://github.com/williamlief/russianAds/raw/master/clean/fb_russia_ads_clean.csv) or [rds](https://github.com/williamlief/russianAds/raw/master/clean/fb_russia_ads_clean.rds) file. A brief description of the ads reach can be found on [my personal website](https://williamlief.com/post/russianads/).

In the House Committee's words: "As part of that continuing effort to educate the public and seek additional analysis, the Committee Minority is making available all IRA advertisements identified by Facebook. This is an effort to be fully transparent with the public, allow outside experts to analyze the data, and provide the American people a fuller accounting of Russian efforts to sow discord and interfere in our democracy." In this repository I aim to further that mission by making the data readily accesible and analyzable.

While I generally agree with their findings, I find that they do not sufficently emphasize the fact that more than a quarter of the 3,500 ads were never seen by anyone, and that only a handful of the ads had any significant reach.
