Let's take a look at just how crazy this pledge gets. That's just nuts! They want candidates to support a constitutional amendment to ban marriage nationwide. This will never happen. For the last decade public support for marriage equality has gone from 35 percent to 55 percent! But they don't stop there. NOM also wants candidates to ""work to overturn any Supreme Court decision"" in favor of the freedom to marry. NOM wants the president to only nominate judges who will uphold marriage bans, but at this point, legal consensus so strongly supports marriage equality that supporting marriage bans is a sign that person isn't qualified to be a judge. Also, NOM wants the candidates to weaken civil rights laws, creating loopholes to let companies and citizens to discriminate if they cite a religious justification. That could actually happen — and it already has in some states — so it's a huge concern. And fifth, they want the Department of Justice to investigate harassment against people who oppose marriage equality. Sure, gays and lesbians are harassed every day, fired, kicked out of their homes and schools, separated from their families, but I really hope soon there'll be NO MORE of it! There's a part of me that feels very sad for NOM's fanatics.

Nothing they worked for made anyone's life better. At all. They didn't win, and they wasted their lives fighting against the inevitable.

Just before midnight, a gunman opened fire outside a relative's home where Amari and other children were playing, hitting both the 7-year-old and a 26-year-old woman in the chest. No arrests have been made. Family members will hold a press conference Sunday afternoon to call for Amari's killer to turn himself in. How can we feel safe here in America?

After eight years on the job, Margie Winters was fired as director of religious education at Waldron Mercy Academy outside Philadelphia not because she just married her wife, but because some parents just found out that she's been married for all eight years. Unfortunately LGBT teachers have long understood that openly expressing their identity in school can make them an easy target for discrimination. It is the biggest mistake! When students perceive that they're not supposed to talk about homosexuality, they conclude that there must be something wrong about being gay. And it's a dangerous message that can lead to bullying and harassment. Gay teachers need to serve as example for kids! It's very powerful both for straight students and for LGBT students to know that they have teachers and people they respect who are LGBT and who are good at their jobs.

Hodges, conservatives are eager to highlight Phillips and the Kleins as evidence that religious freedom is under attack. In fact, they have actually invented a new claim about how these bakers' ""free speech"" is under attack and how they're thus the real victims. There's a simple solution. Since they won't agree to the conditions for having a license to do business with the public, they shouldn't have a license to do business with the public!

In the process, he defaulted on his mortgage and amassed a huge debt totaling $73;000 to M&T Bank. Unfortunately, due to his default on his mortgage loan payments, he was evicted from his house on a stretcher. Why does the U.S. government treat military veterans absolutely disgracefully?

Perhaps new terrorist attacks won't be so large as the 9/11 but there will be more terrorist attacks if the immigration policy won't be tightened. We have a lot of problems that require an active response and decisions from the government: poverty, the problems of veterans, homelessness, racism, law enforcement system and so on.

Black protesters, on the contrary stand against racism. There were also many anti-racism supporters of other races. The main problem is hatred which is spread among our society.

Chief Sewell was hired by Pocomoke City back in 2010 after his retirement from the Baltimore Police Department. Earlier, before Sewell's dismissal he filed a complaint on unequal employment opportunities claiming he was paid less than his white predecessors. This is circumstantial evidence that America is divided into different parts based on race and income. Racism has gotten so bad, black people are treated unfairly.

And when the threat is so real the US intelligence agencies are doing nothing. As a matter of the fact they don't fully perform their duties. First of all, the US security forces should take all appropriate measures to identify people who scour after the wives and children of the U.S. Military. Secondly, families of the U.S. Military should be taken under special protection of the police and the FBI.

Well, this story clearly demonstrates what value for the state the life of a man willing to sacrifice means. In fact the government doesn't care about its soldiers, even if they are heroes. This confirms that the government's slapdash attitude to the recording vets system left more than 35,000 veterans without medical assistance.

Even at home, Williams exhibited acceptance for the LGBT community with his trademark playfulness. While he denied rumours about being gay, he had no qualms about discussing the sexuality of his pet pug. He said: ""I also have a gay rescue pug called Leonard. He has a boyfriend and they are planning to adopt a Siamese kitten together. We're very modern.""

For many parents first reaction probably will be ""How will I ever handle this?"" The answer is simple and difficult at the same time: love and acceptance will help to understand your child's sexuality and its meaning to you and your continued relationship with your son or daughter. Some parents feel they would have been happier not knowing about their child's sexuality. They look back to before they knew and recall this time as problem-free - overlooking the distance they often felt from their child during that time. Sometimes parents try to deny what is happening - by rejecting what they're hearing (""It's just a phase; you'll get over it""); by shutting down (""If you choose that lifestyle, I don't want to hear about it""); or by not registering the impact of what we're being told (""That's nice, dear, and what do you want for dinner?""). Such denial often prove as a traumatizing experience for LGBT children. If you as a parent 'II pretend to forgot the truth about your child's sexuality, you would never really know your child. A large part of his or her life would be kept secret from you, and you would never really know the whole person. It is important to accept and understand your child's sexuality because homosexuality and bisexuality are not a phase. While people may experiment for some time with their sexuality, someone who has reached the point of telling a parent that he or she is gay is not usually going through ""a phase"". On the contrary, he or she has given long and hard thought to understanding and acknowledging his or her sexual orientation.

If a criminal knows you have a gun, he doesn't want to rob you. Of course, not all Americans have a gun, but criminals don't know who is unarmed. Liberals can say that guns increase crime rate. In fact, it is nonsense. Look at statistics: the most gun-friendly state is Wyoming, and it has low crime-rate. The states with high crime rate are states where there are many illegals as usual. So, liberal hysteria is just foolishness. Liberals find reasons of crimes in wrong places. The U.S. Constitution should be saved.

R.I.P to all innocent victims, workers, police officers, firefighters and even dogs that died in this tragedy. This is a day in our history that everyone is going to remember. Today we should honor the memory of the killed ones and share our stories. What were you doing on 9/11? I'd like to tell you #My911 Story. I was only 15 when the attacks occurred. I was at school. I remember that somebody came and told us that there had been a serious bombing in NYC. We all said a prayer for the victims and went back to studies. But a few minutes later all students began receiving calls from their relatives. My mom called me crying. School was letting out early that day.

The teen suffers from Asperger's syndrome, which causes him to strongly dislike being touched or having people in his person space, and is considered legally blind, wearing extremely magnified glasses. Officers thought the non-compliance of Abrams was reason enough to justify forcibly taking him down, which resulted in him being battered and left unconscious. Abrams non-compliance wasn't done out of malice, but out of not really understanding the situation, and believing he hadn't done anything wrong. Abrams' autism makes it extremely difficult for him to interpret the intentions or feelings of others, according to his mother. Police released the teen to the custody of his mother rather than take him to the juvenile detention facility.

And now they claim enourmous victory. Under the Constitution, treaties require the support of two-thirds of the Senate. The deal with Iran is a treaty in every respect — a legally binding long- term agreement between sovereign powers, in which hundreds of billions of dollars will flow and billions of dollars in nuclear materiel will be destroyed. Since this is a treaty and we have 100 senators, Obama should have been obliged to secure the backing of 67 senators, not 41. Obama knows he can never get Iran deal through the Congress. Americans voted for the GOP in 2014 to provide Republican majority in both the House of representatives and the Senate. It has to stop crazy ideas of Obama. But Obama is not stupid, he is very crafty politician. He succeded to change a subject to a vote — not of approval, like a treaty, but of disapproval. It would be treated like any piece of legislation. It would be voted on by the House and the Senate, and if they turned thumbs-down, he could then exercise his presidential veto. The Constitution requires a second vote by the two Houses of Congress to overturn such a veto — and in that case, the vote has to be by two-thirds. So, instead of 67 Senators having to support the deal to make it legal, 67 senators have to disapprove of it to render it null and void. It is enough 60 or more Senators to overturn a veto. But you remember, 41 Senators agree to support the deal. Thus, it may well be that for the first time in American history, a president will simply impose a treaty on the country without even the pretense of seeking and obtaining the advice and consent of the Congress. And how? With 42 percent. Barack Obama is very smart man, but he is not a patriot. He doesn't care about Americans. All what he cares is his outsized ambitions.",https://www.facebook.com/patriototus,United States,18 - 65+,NA,NA,NA,News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile  News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile devices," People who like Being Patriotic, Friends of connections: Friends of people who are connected to Being Patriotic",NA,NA,268,"1,813",395.65 RUB,09/10/15 03:48:38 AM PDT,09/11/15 03:48:37 AM PDT

They were young and Black- that was enough for police officers to decide that they looked suspicious. The police brutality has sparked the movement and has emerged to demand justice and political attention. However, the everyday racism we see was not understood, but ignored. Moreover, the government along with the law enforcement violate our rights through the illegal use of force and mass arrests in order to obstruct our free expression. Yes, standing up for your right to protest for the equality and justice is challenging, but it's worth discrimination and unfairness black civilians face everyday. Remember, knowing your rights can be the most powerful weapon you have against police abuse and brutality. The most famous civil rights activists represent a basic philosophy, known for their fight against injustice and lasting profound impact in the lives of African- Americans. Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Mary McLeod Bethune, Rosa Parks changed our lives forever. But what changes have you made? Have you contributed to a greater equality? What are you doing to fight against injustice and racism? Have you ever protested in civil rights protests or have you ever been part of Black Lives Matter movement?

The shooting took place in classrooms in Snyder Hall. Law enforcement officials have identified Chris Harper Mercer as the man responsible for the mass shooting.He had four weapons on him - three handguns and one assault weapon. Also he was definitely ready to put up a fight, because he had body armor and stash of ammunition. One of the witnesses said that the gunman first asked about people's religions before he began firing. The hospital said that all victims were female between the ages of 18 and 34, and quoted a doctor who said that an ""army"" of doctors and nurses had volunteered to help. It's the 45th shooting at a school so far this year. Obama said that America is the only country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months. And he's right. People already got used to this. Isn't it time for some gun control yet? Some white supremacists say that the killer was mixed and he supported BLM. This information is not confirmed and is more likely to be fake. This dude is definitely not black. His parents are Caucasian. The fact it's been a few hours since the shooting and they haven't say what race he is means he's white. And honestly, word ""shooting"" isn't used correctly here. Can we call it terror? Oh, wait.

I march to fix a system that houses more black men in our prison system than there were black men enslaved in 1850. To fix a system that allows for local prosecutors to investigate their friends at the police department when there is an officer-involved shooting. To fix a system that has drug laws that disproportionately arrest black and brown people for using drugs when white people use at the same rate. To fix a system that has built a private industry off the backs of prisoners laboring for pennies. To fix a system that doesn't video record the actions of law enforcement at all times. To fix a system that criminalizes young women who are pimped and sexually trafficked before they even turn 18. To fix a system that does not collect any national data on incidents when police use excessive force or discharge their firearm. To fix a system that has incarcerated more people than any other nation in the world. To fix a system that has created a school to prison pipeline by harsher school discipline practices for young students of color. To fix a system of policing that targets communities of color by programs like ""Stop & Frisk"" or ""Broken Windows."" This is why I march. This is why we all should march in order to build a better future for our kids. We should fight the institutional racism in the country.

The widespread death, rising racism, mob attacks and police brutality on Blacks coupled with economic deprivation and stark poverty, requires that something must be immediately done to address and correct the condition. We should stop the violence and the killings and present ourselves as a united front before the Government of the United States of America.

Organizers of the Million Man March call for justice, standing against the police and for blacks, Latinos and incarcerated. They say racism rises among the police officers, but in fact it rises among radical groups. Only black activists say ""black lives matter"", forgetting the fact that justice is when all lives matter. Americans are not against blacks, Latinos, etc. But if somebody breaks the law, he should be punished despite of his color or religion. If somebody goes over the speed limit, he should be ticketed. If somebody breaks the immigration law, he should be deported. If somebody kills a man, he should be imprisoned. Given the fact that two Islamic extremists who were arrested one year ago in Ferguson belong to the Nation of Islam, I cannot believe in Farrakhan's benevolent intentions. This Million Man March looks like another liberal overture to black and Muslim communities. This is a bad idea, especially if we take into account the recent news about British jihadi who have published the address of the Navy Seal Robert O'Neill, the man who fatally shot Osama bin Laden, and called on American extremists to execute him.

The goal was to ""disrupt the use of Afghanistan as a terrorist base of operations."" Well, the intervention deprived al-Qaida of a sanctuary. But al-Qaida — even after its leader Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S. commandos — has spawned cells elsewhere and inspired other extremists in Syria and Iraq. And now ISIS is rising as the most powerful terrorist organisation in the world. So, the question is whether it's worth to risk the lives of thousands of American soldiers for the mission that hardly can be called successful?

In the 1730s, a seven-year-old English girl was washed up on the shores of West Africa and was adopted by her rescuers. She became the wife of a Prince and started a dynasty that extends into many of today's Xhosa royal families. Due to her recessive gene, now and then a child is born in the area with bright blue eyes. This is fascinating! This is a pure luck for a Black girl to be adopted and loved after being thrown to the sea. I guess she deserved to be a queen after what she had experienced.

It is well-known how libtards are eager to blame our forefathers for being racist. Yet they always forget to underpin their empty words with facts. Not like all these SJWs, let's refer to racial discrimination in the army of Union. A black soldier was paid $10 a month with a $3 clothing fee taken out, while a white soldier was paid $13 a month but was not forced to pay a clothing allowance. Almost a twofold difference! How tolerant tho! And what was going on in the ""racist"" Confederate States Army? Every soldier was paid $11/month until 1864 regardless of his skin color.

This is how it looks like when A White Police kills a black Civiliian, and also feels it's his right to sue the dead because sympathizers gave him a sleepless night. If it was lawful to kill Quintonio LeGrier because he was in abnormal state of mind according to the cops, then we ask, how about the shooting of Bettie Jones? The story is always rewritten and painted when it comes to dealing with race. Racial disparity and segregation cannot be overlooked in America. There is too much level of inhumanity.

Most people are jailed because one way or the other there was no money to do what was necessary at a particular time even though they were innocent. Prosecutors have developed this platform as a gold mine, extracting huge sum of money from civilians. You can be put behind bars if you fail to comply with the demands. Suddenly one's life becomes tattered when jail comes in, because there is no freedom of making a better living. Federal prosecutors should shake up and hold judges and all these people who take advantages of people by making them pay huge sums of money or put someone behind bars because he/she couldn't pay a fine.

Clark from one cell to another. According to police reports; Ariel J. Clark, 31 was too combative with officers and was threatening to kill them during his arrest. On February 17, a motorist called 911 after interacting with Clark; reporting that Clark, who was driving his wife and two children from Buffulo to Texas, was threatening to kill him and his son. Clark's wife said that a man and his son began to argue with her husband, who had been acting wierd because he hadn't slept in five days. When the police arrived. Clark was arrested, taken to the Fairfield County Jail where he was placed in a restraint chair for his combative behavior. Three days after arriving in jail, Clark had some breathing difficulties and deputies started chest compression. But an hour later he was pronounced dead at a local hospital. An investigation has been opened after the death of a Fairfield County Jail inmate. Now the question is whether the jail's standard operating procedures were followed.

The video shows how officers, Michelle Morsi-Murphy and Jose Lopez, brutalized Rev. Catherine Brown. Brown was driving back home; when Morsi- Murphy jumped out of the car and approached her yelling curse words and demanding she move the vehicle back. When Brown reached for her license; Lopez pointed a gun at her head. Moreover, Lopez WAS LAUGHTING at poor Brown; who was beat and pepper-sprayed by police. Brown is not the only victim, her kids had suffered from pepper spray too. The US police is just insane. What's the problem with peaceful arrest? Why the hell they treat us as animals? This will not stop until cops are held personally and financially responsible for their actions. Could you imagine, if soldiers acted like this towards civilians in a combat zone? 100% it would be treated as a war crime.

Jail officers said Bethea had threatened them and that's why he was hit with a stun gun but I guess cops didn't know the camera was recording them. FIVE OFFICERS stood over Bethea and just watching how Clark pulled the trigger two more times. As usual, no charges were ever filed against the officers involved in Bethea's death. There is no doubt that Bethea was murdered. Have you noticed that it took 20 minutes passed by before another officer summoned a nurse and they attempted to revive Bethea.

Could you imagine how off-duty deputy Tracy Weiss was shocked when she realized that her budge won't protect her from paying parking fines? Her face is priceless. The story happened last month when Weiss found her car being towed for illegal parking. The cop jumped into another vehicle to block the driver, who had towed her car. When she exited the vehicle she had her gun drawn. The driver started recording the incident when he understood that his life is under threat. That's how $62.50 fine turned into $125. The sheriff's office said Weiss has been an Orange County deputy for 11 years and they are investigating the incident. I have only one question: is that how PD trains police in our country? For 11 years she should know how to fix the situation like that. The only reason she should identify herself as an officer is to explain why she has a holstered weapon. Aside from that she should not have mentioned it nor should she have drawn the weapon. To my mind, this woman need to stop being a deputy and carrying a gun. Such cops and people as well should stay away from guns. This would give our citizens a chance to get back home alive.

These videos and instances have become so common that people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were wondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now, karma's coming back for blue pigs! A shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police officers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two officers for seemingly no reason. The incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two school police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza shop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of police do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do literally nothing without using their guns. Cops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their own laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with chemical and electrical ways, rape or even kill you ""doing their job."" All those things and more are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my rights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America. Look around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine about it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is why cops are so violent now.

The beer wasn't in his car, and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows that he had no alcohol in his system. So what's the problem with you guys?

According to the Philadelphia Student Union, of which the alleged victim, Brian Burney, the incident was all over a dispute over using the bathroom.

I don't understand why are there cops in schools? Cops are nothing more then a bunch of bullies or gang members in police uniforms! Whatever happened to deans? Moreover, don't you think it's a bit strange, when an officer forces someone to delete video? Obviously, police is trying to hide something and their testimony should be considered a lie.

But if you are in a member of a club, you can be sure that no one will ever let your secrets out. Statistically, 46% of cops admit to witnessing misconduct by other cops! Also, 73 % of the individuals pressuring officers to keep quiet about the misconduct are leaders. 8% of the officers who admitted to intentionally withholding the information about officer misconduct were upper administrators. Cops will always lie to suit interaction or conversation. Sadly enough,""Sworn officer of the court"" is most likely to lie than the citizen he is even accusing.

These videos and instances have become so common that people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were wondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now, karma's coming back for blue pigs! A shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police officers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two officers for seemingly no reason. The incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two school police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza shop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of police do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do literally nothing without using their guns. Cops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their own laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with chemical and electrical ways, rape or even kill you ""doing their job."" All those things and more are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my rights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America. Look around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine about it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is why cops are so violent now. If we want to stop it, we should fight as our ancestors did it for centuries. Take out a few dozen cops and the rest will change.

Back in 2015, Douglas Babbitt was talking on the phone in the driver's seat of his parked van when a police officer asked if an open beer bottle on the ground near the vehicle's front passenger door belonged to him. Notice the location of the beer can - it's located on the ground, outside of the vehicle, on the passenger's side. When Babbitt said the beer wasn't his, the police needlessly escalated the situation that lead to Babbitt's arrest, and left the 51-year-old Oakland man briefly lying unconscious on the ground. The beer wasn't in his car, and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows that he had no alcohol in his system. So what's the problem with you guys?

These videos and instances have become so common that people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were wondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now, karma's coming back for blue pigs! A shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police officers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two officers for seemingly no reason. The incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two school police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza shop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of police do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do literally nothing without using their guns. Cops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their own laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with chemical and electrical ways, rape or even kill you ""doing their job."" All those things and more are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my rights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America. Look around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine about it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is why cops are so violent now. If we want to stop it, we should fight as our ancestors did it for centuries. Take out a few dozen cops and the rest will change.

Back in 2015, Douglas Babbitt was talking on the phone in the driver's seat of his parked van when a police officer asked if an open beer bottle on the ground near the vehicle's front passenger door belonged to him. Notice the location of the beer can - it's located on the ground, outside of the vehicle, on the passenger's side. When Babbitt said the beer wasn't his, the police needlessly escalated the situation that lead to Babbitt's arrest, and left the 51-year-old Oakland man briefly lying unconscious on the ground. The beer wasn't in his car, and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows that he had no alcohol in his system. So what's the problem with you guys?

Johnson was a black U.S. military veteran of the Afghan war. As he was captured, he claimed he wanted to ""kill white people"". There's no evidence that he was a Black Lives Matters activist. There's no proof that he was into the movement anyhow. It happened almost a week ago and the police can't show anything to prove there was a link between Micah X. Johnson and Black Lives matter. But the Main stream media are telling us time and again that «black lives matter terrorists are killing the police officers». The main stream Media are telling us, that the protest against police terror is a violent anti-government riot!

October 22nd is a day that people around the nation have mobilized every year since 1996 for a National Day of Protest to Stop Police Brutality, Repression and the Criminalization of a Generation. Here in Charlotte, this problem appears especially hard. A number of victims and quantity of cases, where justice wasn't served - horrifies. The most well- known case is shooting of Jonathan Ferrell, an unarmed black man who was shot ten times and killed. Or situation with Daniel Kevin Harris, a deaf man, who just couldn't explain a thing, before he was shot. We need to use our right to protest to demand the authorities and police representatives, to do, the thing they are supposed to do! To protect and serve! Not to kill, damage and cripple!

As far as Mr. Trump pursues the goal of creating more jobs and supports the working class. He said he would put miners back to work. We could help Mr. Trump win Pennsylvania which is a battleground state. We'd like to organize a rally ""Miners for Trump"" in Pennsylvania. Have something against coal industries? Please note then that burning coal is not more harmful than lumber. Alternative energy is only possible when subsidized by government for it is not lucrative.

Their idea was simple - we can't just talk to make the change, we must take action. They started to monitor the behavior of police officers and challenge police brutality in Oakland, California. And they succeeded. Unfortunately, the government and especially Federal Bureau of Investigation called the party ""the greatest threat to the internal security of the country"". They tried to close it, to incarcerate BPP's participants, and in 1982 the original party was dissolved. 50 years have passed since BBP's foundation, but the situation in the country stills the same. Cops are shooting Blacks. It spreads through all the country like the disease. Nowadays we need Black Panthers as never before. We need a strong hand that can protect us, that can keep our people safe, that can make Black Lives really matter. Let's get together and celebrate the 50th anniversary of the party that has made the change. Let's honor its founders and participants. Let's share their ideas and ideals!

It is unacceptable for us to see them ruin all we've been building for decades. For centuries. The establishment thinks they can treat us like stupid sheep but they are wrong. We won't put up with this anymore. The corrupt media does not talk about the crimes committed by Killary Rotten Clinton, neither does it mention the leaked emails but it would rather keep on kicking around some outdated tapes featuring Trump. Even Republicans are now offering her a victory by renouncing their nominee. What is this if not treason? No, no, no. We are free citizens of Texas and we've had enough of this cheap show on the screen. We're ready to prove our commitment to liberty, low taxes and gun rights. If Trump wins, there will be a possibility to secede peacefully but not without tension. What will happen if Hitlery becomes President? Higher taxes to feed undocumented aliens. More refugees, mosques, and terrorist attacks. Banned guns. Continuing economic depression. Let's remind them what Texas is made of and show that we're ready to SECEDE!

According to ex-cop's attorneys, their defendant acted in self- defense despite the fact that Scott was unarmed and Slager fired eight times, hitting Scott five times from behind. Slager's defense attorney's: ""The double-teaming of Slager ... is a chilling example of how far politically motivated politicians and prosecutors will go to seek headlines and feather their own nests at the expense of a public servant ... who had to make a split- second life or death decision that will be second-guessed by comfortable armchair quarterbacks. This is unconscionable.' The shooting occurred in April 2015 when Slager stopped Scott for a broken brake light on the Mercedes-Benz he was driving. According to Slager's dashcam, ex-cop asked Scott to show his driving license and questioned him about documents for the car. When Slager returned to his car, Walter Scott jumped out of the car and ran away giving Slager chase. According to a bystander's video, Scott ran away from the officer when Slager opened fire. We've seen what happened in different parts of America: unarmed dead black bodies lying across the streets at the hands of police officers and none of them found guilty.

The shop was selling the books of black writers. The next year the owners of Drum and Spear launched its own publishing company. One of co-founders said ""We don't define profit in terms of money. The profit is the patronage of the community, which allows the store to self-support."" Drum and Spear was aimed to show people the true black culture and history, something beyond the American school program. It's reflected in the name of the shop: the drum is for ""communications within the diaspora,"" and the spear symbolizes ""whatever else might be necessary for the liberation of the people."" The best-sellers of early 70s in this shop were such books as the Autobiography of Malcolm X and Eldridge Cleaver's Soul on Ice. This bookstore inspired people around the country to open similar bookstores. Drum and Spear and many other stores were not only the shops, but a ""free spaces""for thinking black people where folks could meet and discuss the vital issues. Let's not forget our legacy!

Non-profit organization the Southwest Atlanta Youth Business Organization(SWAYBO)also helped Leon in many ways. According to blacknews.com, the organization gave him lessons of ""poise and presentation, public speaking, sales and marketing at marketplaces and how to perform basic accounting formulas.

Coleman explained how his work with wrongfully-convicted clients had shaped his view of the U.S. criminal justice system, which he described as racially lopsided.

If most of the people going into the system are black men, most of my clients will be too.""

After the critics complained about the Army's unfair burden on black women's hair, the U.S. Army again lifted the ban on dreadlocks that was instated in April 2014. The ban faced an instant backlash from black women so the Army unbanned braids and twists amidst the criticism. Some of the female soldiers used harsh chemicals to keep their hair straight. Moreover, every eight weeks it cost them to $80. Thus, the ban on dreadlocks caused a lot of unnecessary stress. The ban on locs, which was part of Army Regulation 670-1, remained until January 2017. The new rules offered female soldiers another hairstyle option. Now the rules allow dreadlocks and locks but only if they are less than a half- inch wide.

Since that moment Ebony's mother called her ""Dr. Hilton"". It wasn't easy to follow the dream for Ebony. Or it's better to say that there were some hardships — for example, Ebony was growing without a father etc, but despite these things she successfully got the proper education and became the first black female anesthesiologist in 2013. Hilton says she never had plan B. Now she is mentoring youth as a member of program called Girls Loving OurSelves Successfully (GLOSS). That's sweet. Black women always show the power in any conditions. That's inspiring! And it's especially good that Hilton dedicated herself to teaching others. #blackexcellence #blackperfection #blackbeauty #blackbusiness #africanamerican #blackcommunity #melanin #blackpride #blackout #america #usa #blackscience #education #diversity #ebonyhilton #blackgirlmagic",https://www.facebook.com/iloveblackexcellence,United States,18 - 65+,NA,NA,NA,News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile  News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile devices," Interests: Martin Luther King, Jr., My Black is Beautiful, Black is beautiful or Black Girls Rock!","Match: Interests: Martin Luther King, Jr., My Black is Beautiful,",NA,750,"4,706",400.00 RUB,03/16/17 07:26:14 AM PDT,03/17/17 07:26:14 AM PDT

TWO GEORGIA POLICE OFFICERS HAVE BEEN FIRED AFTER VIDEO SHOWS THEM KICK BLACK MAN DURING TRAFFIC STOP Two Georgia police officers have been fired after police released the footage of the encounter where two Gwinnett County cops kicking a black college student during a traffic stop. According to a police report; 21-year-old Demetrius Hollins was pulled over near Lawrenceville for changing lines several times without signaling. When cops stopped him ; Hollins was seen on video standing with his hands raised before one of the officers was seen punching the motorist in his face; and the second cop racing to the scene later, only to stomp Hollins in his face. The 21-year-old man said he feared for his life when he saw police approach him. Hollins raised his hands up in order to let him know that he didn't have anything where he could hurt him, but police beat him. Moreover, after the incident cops wrote in their police report that Hollins resisted arrest and claimed that Hollins refused to place his hands behind his back and resisted arrest. Cops literally lied and had no shame. This incident embarrassed and the Gwinnett County police and all law enforcement. They should be held accountable for their actions. Resignation is not the answer. We did not hear any criminal charges. even though they admit the cops broke the law. Where is the justice?

Sadly days after days and weeks after weeks of Trump's presidency there are no changes in that direction. Israel captured a Syrian region named Golan Heights in 1967, and today this land is internationally considered to be occupied territory. Israelis want to use Trump's influence so the world would acknowledge Israeli sovereignty. Trump is a dealer, and maybe he's trying make a deal out of it, but there's one important thing here: under no circumstances can our soldiers' lives be put at risk for that.

According to the New York Police Department, the biggest part of arrests are low-level offenses like peeing on the street or disorderly conduct. The New York Daily News reports that 81 percent of the 7.3 million people hit with summonses between 2001 and 2013 were black and Hispanic. So what should we do? The criminal penal system is antiquated. It should be changed. The worse, it is now designed to be for profit which has led to laws being designed to keep people in prison, rather than rehabilitating. More and more it looks like it's a business. The first rule of any society is development. At such rate the US government will start to sell indulgences soon. Our system is not only unfair, but also corrupt!

When the suspect began using racial slurs against the man who asked him for money, one of the students attempted to intervene. The attacker then turned his wrath on the two students, stopping his motorcycle in front of Usama's car and approaching Usama's friend, who had gotten out of the car. The suspect called his friend ""brown trash"" and told him he had to ""leave this country,"" According to Usama's account, his friend responded: ""This is my country.

We know that you defend American Muslims now in your presidential campaign, but did you support us before campaign? We didn't forget who supported the war in Iraq, we are Muslims and Americans, so we know your support to invade Iraq in 2003 have caused hundreds of American soldiers to die hundreds of miles away from their homes, and also millions of Iraqi Muslims, including innocent men, women and children, to die in their homes, and for what? Libya! You supported bombing and destroying the whole country just to kill AI- Gaddafi. You said in an interview: ""We came, we saw, he died"". Let's not forget about Benghazi, where you declined to increase the embassy security, and that caused the death of the U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith and CIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty and Ten others were also injured in the attacks. You killed Saddam Hussein and AI-Gaddafi in Iraq and Lybia leaving the countries there in chaos, which led to the birth of ISIS, which is now a threat not only to the U.S. but the whole world! You are supporting gun control, disarming the American citizens and at the same time selling weapons to groups in the Middle East to fight their leaders, creating on the short run terrorist groups as we saw in Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. 8 years ago you were against refugees, but now you support them. 10 years ago you were against same sex marriage, but now you support it. You change your views very fast. You speak as a democrat and act as a republican. Sorry, but you can not be our representer, you can not be the president of the United States.

Two months before his death, he proposed to his longtime girlfriend and the mother of two sons. Joshua Beal had come to Chicago to serve as a pallbearer in the funeral of his cousin Marcus Washington who was fatally shot on October 27, 2016 in Indianapolis at the age of 26. Beal was fatally shot after he and several relatives were involved in what authorities called a road rage incident with an off-duty police officer and an off- duty firefighter. The relatives along with others in the caravan were headed to Southwest Memorial Chapel after burying their cousin Marcus Washington, she said. Suddenly, Boxley said, a car cut her off and then tried to run her 17-year-old sister off the road. She said her family as well as the motorist who had cut her off — who she believed was a Chicago police officer — stopped and got out of their cars. At some point the man pushed her female cousin to the ground and pulled a gun on her, pointing it at her face, according to Boxley. She said the man got inside his car but exited again and ""he just started shooting,"" hitting the windshield of a car containing Beal, who had pulled his gun when he saw the man holding a gun on their cousin. Boxley said Beal legally owned the gun and did not fire it. Boxley said the man pulled Beal out of his front passenger seat and began shooting him. ""I was hoping my brother wasn't dead,"" said Boxley. Beal's mother said he was a father to two children, a 4-year-old and a 2-year- old, and that his fiancee was a stay-at-home mother. ""This is what CPD do. They tear our families apart over and over again. They have no consideration for life,"" - Tiffaney Boxley. Yet another father of two has been shot, and despite what the cop's report will say, i know there can never be a way a Black man isn't guilty for his own death, armed or unarmed. #joshuabeal #altonsterling #TerenceCrutcher #westandtogether #blacklivesmatter #unite4justice",https://www.facebook.com/Woke-Blacks-294234600956431/,United States,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Martin Luther King, Jr., African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954-68), African-American history or Malcolm X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As we all know, CPS has been struggling financially, and your donation has really given us a push to get to where we need to be and possibly motivate others to give back to the community as well. This is only one of the many things that you have done to improve our Chicago... All of the things that you do for our city never go unnoticed. All of the free concerts you host and all the time you spend here in the city really show you care. We notice it. We look up to you because the fame usually takes humility away from artists, but it hasn't changed you... We thank you for supporting Chicago's minority youth when not many others have put time to think about the kids. As minority students we feel ignored and as though we don't have enough support from bigger influences like you. Being born and raised in Chicago is not easy at all. There are so many stereotypes and restrictions we have as teenagers due to the frequent violence and crimes. Your music puts some at ease because we know that someone cares and someone has experienced these daily struggles too. You and your music have taught us that you can be true to yourself and still be successful, still be self-made... Once again, thank you for aiding us and giving something back to the city we know and love, Chicago. Sincerely, Alex Rojas, Alondra Cerros, and Annelisse Betancourt Lake View High School Students Chicago, Illinois"" It's not the full letter, but some extracts. It's sweet to observe how young people don't hesitate to express their gratitude and respond to someone who cares for them. We are sure, that Chano needs it. Love should be given back. It should work. As an independent artist he got people's support and Chance didn't forget who made him famous. Artists are made of talent, work and people's love. That's cool that this love goes back and forth! We need more of these positive black people on the media, because some people forget how much love and care black people show. Hopefully one day different race will be the issue of diversity, not stereotypes. #blackexcellence #blackperfection #blackbeauty #blackbusiness #africanamerican #blackcommunity #melanin #blackpride #blackout #america #usa #blackscience #education #diversity #chancetherapper #chicago #music #hiphop #rap",https://www.facebook.com/iloveblackexcellence,United States,18 - 65+,NA,NA,NA,News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile  News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile devices," Interests: Martin Luther King, Jr., My Black is Beautiful, Black is beautiful or Black Girls Rock!","Match: Interests: Martin Luther King, Jr., My Black is Beautiful,",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
